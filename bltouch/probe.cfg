[bltouch]
sensor_pin: ^PB1
#   Pin connected to the BLTouch sensor pin. Most BLTouch devices
#   require a pullup on the sensor pin (prefix the pin name with "^").
#   This parameter must be provided.
control_pin: PB0
#   Pin connected to the BLTouch control pin. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pin_move_time: 0.680
#   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for the BLTouch pin to
#   move up or down. The default is 0.680 seconds.
#stow_on_each_sample: True
#   This determines if Klipper should command the pin to move up
#   between each probe attempt when performing a multiple probe
#   sequence. Read the directions in docs/BLTouch.md before setting
#   this to False. The default is True.
#probe_with_touch_mode: False
#   If this is set to True then Klipper will probe with the device in
#   "touch_mode". The default is False (probing in "pin_down" mode).
#pin_up_reports_not_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports the probe in a "not
#   triggered" state after a successful "pin_up" command. This should
#   be True for all genuine BLTouch devices. Read the directions in
#   docs/BLTouch.md before setting this to False. The default is True.
#pin_up_touch_mode_reports_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports a "triggered" state after
#   the commands "pin_up" followed by "touch_mode". This should be
#   True for all genuine BLTouch devices. Read the directions in
#   docs/BLTouch.md before setting this to False. The default is True.
#set_output_mode:
#   Request a specific sensor pin output mode on the BLTouch V3.0 (and
#   later). This setting should not be used on other types of probes.
#   Set to "5V" to request a sensor pin output of 5 Volts (only use if
#   the controller board needs 5V mode and is 5V tolerant on its input
#   signal line). Set to "OD" to request the sensor pin output use
#   open drain mode. The default is to not request an output mode.
x_offset: -50.6
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
y_offset: -9.3
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.
z_offset: 1.688
#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 5
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
samples: 20
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
sample_retract_dist: 2
#   The distance (in mm) to lift the toolhead between each sample (if
#   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
samples_result: average
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
samples_tolerance: 0.7
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
samples_tolerance_retries: 1
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.
